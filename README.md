## Description

This is a day planning app that splits the day into hours and allows the user to write todos/notes and saves them in localStorage. It also updates the current time dynamically by using Moment.js.

## Usage

Upon visiting the app, you will see the current day and time, as well as a section that displays rows representing hour segments in the day:

![Main section](screenshots/main-section.png?raw=true "Main section")

In each hour row, you can add notes or todo items. When you click the green save button on the right, the text is saved in local storage:

![Hour sections](screenshots/hour-sections.png?raw=true "Hour sections")

## Installation

Type the following into your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/derekstoeckmann/day-planner.git`

## Wishlist

In the future, I'd like to add:

- Make responsive
- Make the save button display a message saying 'saved!'.
