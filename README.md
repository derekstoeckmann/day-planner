## Description

This is a day planning app that splits the day into hours and allows the user to write todos/notes and saves them in localStorage. It also updates the current time dynamically by using Moment.js.

## Installation

Type the following into your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/derekstoeckmann/day-planner.git`

For further instructions, visit https://help.github.com.

## Future_Improvements

In the future, I'd like to add:

- Make responsive
- Make the save button display a message saying 'saved!'.
